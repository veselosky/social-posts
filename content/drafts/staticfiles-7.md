## 7️⃣ “What I’d Teach Junior Django Devs First”

**(Mentorship / Thought Leadership)**

**Hook:**
If I had to teach Django deployment in one lesson, it wouldn’t be Docker.

It would be static files.

**Body:**
Because static files force you to understand:
• Build vs runtime
• Caching vs correctness
• Immutable assets
• Separation of concerns

Once you grasp static files, everything else clicks:
CDNs, containers, rolling deploys, even frontend builds.

Static files are the gateway drug to real backend thinking.

**CTA:**
I’ve written the guide I wish I had when I learned Django.
