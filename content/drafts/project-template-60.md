🚀 **Announcing: My Django Project Template — Now Updated for Django 6.0**

Django 6.0 is here, and I’ve just updated my **opinionated Django project template** to match it.

If you’ve ever run `django-admin startproject` and immediately thought
“OK… now I need to fix *everything* before I can actually start,”
this template is for you.

### What this template is (and isn’t)

✅ **Optimized for Django 6.0**
✅ Built for **solo developers & small teams**
✅ Opinionated, pragmatic, boring-in-the-best-way
❌ Not trying to be everything for everyone

This is the setup I’ve refined over **15+ years of Django work**, baked into a reusable starting point so you don’t waste the first day (or week) on scaffolding.

### What you get out of the box

* Modern dependency management with **`uv`**
* Sensible defaults for **local dev, CI, and production**
* **Granian** instead of Gunicorn for fast ASGI/WSGI
* Debug Toolbar, IPython, Ruff, pre-commit, Tox — already wired up
* GitHub Actions with a real test matrix (Python 3.12–3.14)
* SQLite configured *correctly* (WAL, IMMEDIATE, sane performance defaults)
* No settings-file explosion, no secret leakage footguns

All the things you *always* add anyway — already done.

### Why another template?

Django’s default template is intentionally minimal.
That’s fine — but real projects aren’t.

This one reflects how Django is actually used in production today, without forcing you into a giant framework or magical abstractions.

If it doesn’t fit your workflow, great — but if it does, it can save you hours on every new project.
