title: 'Need Want Ask For'
---

Are you giving your customer what they need, what they want, or what they ask for?

As a professional, it's your job to understand what your customer needs. They only know what they want. And they often have difficulty articulating what they want, so it's rarely the same as what they ask for.

Accessibility, performance, testing, error monitoring. All stuff they need. Never something they'll ask for.
