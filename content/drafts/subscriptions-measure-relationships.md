title: Subscriptions Measure Relationships

Creators: donâ€™t fall into the same trap as newspapers.

Subscriptions aren't about revenue. They're about relationships.

Don't get me wrong. Regular, recurring revenue from subscriptions is a great boon to a creator's business. But that number is just a proxy for the value of the relationship you have with the subscriber.

The real value comes from that relationship, and relationships are built on trust and mutual benefit. If you demand credit card information before it's really needed, or hide the Cancel button behind layers of indirection, you're damaging that trust and diminishing the value of that relationship. Don't be surprised when subscribers bail.

Focus on building the relationship. The revenue will follow.
