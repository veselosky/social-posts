title: 'Vision Drive Focus'
---
Success in any endeavor requires three things:

Vision. Drive. Focus.

Vision: because if you don't know where you're going, you'll never get there.

Drive: because even if you're on the right track, you'll get run over if you just stand still.

Focus: because saying yes to the right thing usually means saying no to almost everything else.

Get clear. Get moving. Stay locked in. Thatâ€™s the formula.
