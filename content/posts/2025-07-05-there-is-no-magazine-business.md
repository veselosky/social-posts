"There is no magazine business. Every magazine is in a different business."

Here's why that matters to creators in 2025:

James B. Kobak wrote that in the introduction to his book "How to Start a Magazine" in 2002. Kobak said that each magazine is different because it has different readers and different advertisers, and therefore what works for one may not work for another.

The key insight here applies to all media businesses (and maybe all businesses generally): 

Your business is your 𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘮𝘶𝘯𝘪𝘵𝘺. 

- 📖 The content you create brings a community together.
- 🧑‍💼 The sponsors you promote become part of that community.
- 🤝 You create value for your sponsors AND your audience by connecting them.

Keep those principles top of mind if you want to be a successful creator.
