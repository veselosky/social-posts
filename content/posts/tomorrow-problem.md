title: 'Tomorrow Problem'
---
One of the **most valuable time-saving skills** I have developed over the years is recognizing a **Tomorrow Problem.** 
What's a Tomorrow Problem?

You find yourself at the end of a work day. You've been grinding on this task for hours now. It's fighting you the whole way. 
You're exhausted. 
You're frustrated. 
You *know* there's a simple solution. 
But you just can't get there.

You have two options:
1. Work late, continue grinding for hours, growing ever more frustrated.
2. Or close the laptop. Have a good meal. Get a good night's sleep. Re-engage with fresh eyes tomorrow.

Nine out of ten times, the second option is the winner. Coming back with renewed energy and fresh eyes, the simple solution you were struggling to find presents itself immediately.

The problem is solved in minutes instead of hours.

Recognizing a Tomorrow Problem isnâ€™t about *the problem*.
Itâ€™s about recognizing your limits. Knowing when your brain is done for the day.

ðŸ‘‰ Thatâ€™s not laziness. Thatâ€™s discipline.
ðŸ‘‰ Thatâ€™s not procrastination. Thatâ€™s strategy.
