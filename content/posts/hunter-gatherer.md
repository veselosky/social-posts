title: 'Hunter Gatherer'
---
When all humans were hunter-gatherers, did anybody care about productivity?

Like, did people have berry-gathering quotas?

Did the shaman have one-on-one meetings with his direct reports? Was he like, "You know, I've been counting your berries, and you're gathering 20% fewer berries than the other members of the tribe. What do you think we should do about that?"

Did the chief announce at the tribal all-hands meeting that the tribe's target for the quarter was to gather 9% more berries than the previous quarter?

Did they annually stack-rank all the members of the tribe by berry count and exile the bottom 10% of gatherers?

I don't know, I'm not an anthropologist. But that doesn't feel true to me.

I have a feeling the conversations were more like, hey, we have enough food to feed the tribe for a few days. Let's head back to camp. Have a good meal. Maybe dance around the fire a bit after the sun goes down. If we're lucky, maybe one of the old-timers will tell us some funny stories about the old days.

I know, the modern world does have its advantages. Penicillin. No polio is good. Internet, so helpful.

But sometimes I wonder if what we gave up is worth what we gained. Did we surrender our humanity to become cogs in this machine we call "civilization"?

And I wonder, did we really have to give it up? Or were we tricked into it by someone with ulterior motives? Did they destroy the tribe to build themselves an empire on the backs of the people?
