title: 'Serverless Static'
---
🔥 **“Serverless” was a lie.**

For years, tech marketing told us we could *eliminate servers* with Functions-as-a-Service. But all we really did was move complexity around.

CloudFormation stacks. Cold-start hacks. We didn’t remove the server — we just hid it under layers of YAML.

The *real* breakthrough wasn’t “serverless.”
It was *static.*

👉 A static site **builds once** — then serves pure, pre-generated HTML from storage.
No databases. No load balancers. No runaway costs.
Just reliability, simplicity, and speed.

When something breaks, it breaks *at build time* — not in production.

Static sites are what “serverless” was *supposed* to be.

💡 I’m starting a long series on **Static Site Architecture** — diving deep into why the future of the web is *pre-generated*, not dynamically rendered — and how tools like **Hugo** make it practical, fast, and scalable.
