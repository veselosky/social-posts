Suffering from writer's block?

ü•î What can a bag of potato chips teach us about overcoming writer's block?

Honestly, probably nothing. It's just that I happened to look over at the table and there's a bag of potato chips over there.

I know what you're thinking. Writing about a random bag of potato chips is a *terrible* idea. And you're right.

But you know, sometimes we just don't have any *good* ideas, right? So what are you going to do? Stare at the blank page, growing ever more frustrated while that black lump of self-doubt in the back of our mind grows until it swallows you whole?

Not recommended.

Sometimes your brain just needs permission to suck. When you don't have any good ideas, write a bad one. Write the worst idea you can think of. Because it will break the log jam. And once words are flowing again, you can steer them toward a more positive objective. Tada! No more writer's block! üéâÔ∏è 

Huh, maybe that bag of potato chips had something to teach us after all.
