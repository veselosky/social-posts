title: Better Than You Found It

A piece of wisdom from my military days: Always leave a place better than you found it.

I remember once in boot camp we were on a training exercise. Our squad was supposed to set up our "headquarters" in an ancient Quonset hut.

The place was a mess. The window sills were covered in dead flies. The floor was covered in dirt. There were piles of trash in the corners.

The drill instructor put us to work cleaning. He wanted the place spotless, the floor shiny with wax, the window sills clean enough to eat off of.

Naturally, we complained. After all, we didn't make this mess, why should we have to clean it up?

The squad leader explained it like this: We didn't make the mess, but if it was still there after we left, everyone would think we had made it. So either way, it was our mess now.

I remember that every time I step into a new situation, whether it's a project, a job, a relationship. How many companies have you joined where every problem got blamed on the last guy who left? I've seen plenty. And I don't want to be that guy.

Always leave a place better than you found it, because from everyone else's perspective, it's your mess to clean up.
