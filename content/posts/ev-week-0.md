I ditched my gas-burner! Here’s what I 𝘸𝘰𝘯’𝘵 miss — and what I had to change.

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗜 𝘄𝗼𝗻’𝘁 𝗺𝗶𝘀𝘀:
📅 Annual emissions inspections $
🔧 Oil changes $$
☣️ Toxic garage chemicals
⛽ Wasting time + gas driving 𝘵𝘰 𝘨𝘦𝘵 𝘨𝘢𝘴

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲𝗱 (𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘄𝗵𝘆 𝗶𝘁’𝘀 𝗯𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿):
Like a lot of suburbanites, I was parking my car in the driveway while my garage collected junk.

Getting an EV forced me to clean out the garage — a big win, honestly. So now my car has a room of its own, and charges at home while I sleep.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 #1 𝗤𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗜 𝗚𝗲𝘁:
“But what about installing a charger? Isn’t that expensive?”

Here’s the thing: I didn’t install one.
No fancy Level 2 charger. Just a normal wall outlet ("Level 1"). ⚡
That adds ~50 miles of range overnight. I rarely drive more than that in a day.
Translation: I wake up every morning with a full "tank"!

𝗥𝘂𝗹𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗧𝗵𝘂𝗺𝗯:
➡️ If you burn a full tank weekly, you’ll want access to Level 2 charging.
➡️ If you go 10+ days between gas stops, Level 1 is probably all you need.

𝗕𝗼𝘁𝘁𝗼𝗺 𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲:
“Waking up to a full tank” beats “waiting in line at the gas station” every day of the week. ⛽🚫
