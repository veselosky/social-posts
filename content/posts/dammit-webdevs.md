Dammit, web developers! Y'all 𝗛𝗔𝗩𝗘 to start 𝘁𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗲𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗸𝗲𝘆𝗯𝗼𝗮𝗿𝗱 𝗮𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀! Seriously. Some reasons I may not be able to use a mouse:


• I may be vision impaired and unable to see the mouse cursor.

• I may be paralyzed from the neck down.

• Maybe my mouse battery just died.

• Maybe I have a repetitive stress injury (RSI).

• Maybe my hand is in a cast. Maybe I broke it 𝘱𝘶𝘯𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘢 𝘸𝘦𝘣 𝘥𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘭𝘰𝘱𝘦𝘳 𝘸𝘩𝘰 𝘣𝘶𝘪𝘭𝘵 𝘢𝘯 𝘪𝘯𝘢𝘤𝘤𝘦𝘴𝘴𝘪𝘣𝘭𝘦 𝘸𝘦𝘣 𝘴𝘪𝘵𝘦!


It's not even hard! It's the TAB key, over there on the left side of the keyboard. I know you don't use it much anymore because your IDE indents your code for you, but trust me, it works.


Hit TAB once. Don't see a "skip to main content" link? That's a bug. 🐞 


Don't see where the focus went? That's a bug. 🐜 


Keep hitting TAB. Does the focus disappear or go somewhere totally unexpected? That's a bug. 🦟 


Can't reach a control on the page? That's a bug. 🪳 


Can't activate a button with the space bar because it's not a <button> but just a <div> with a click handler attached? 😡 💢 🕷️ That's three bugs in one and whoever wrote that code needs to sit in the corner wearing a dunce cap and watch the grown-ups write web apps that actually work.
