title: 'Software Carpentry'
---
I am not a computer scientist. I am not an engineer.
I call myself a software developer.
But really what I do is carpentry.

A carpenter assembles useful structures out of predefined components. A carpenter can take a pile of two by fours and plywood, a few boxes of nails, and some basic tools, and build a house.

Most software work is just like that. Assembling off the shelf components using common tools to produce useful software.

Both of these are skilled crafts, the mastery of which requires experience, practice, and hard-won knowledge. Neither requires much math nor a college degree.

A carpenter probably can't calculate the total load of the roof on a house. But he knows that two by four stud walls need to be 16" on center to make a stable structure.

A carpenter probably can't explain the math behind the Pythagorean theorem. But she knows how to square a corner using the 3-4-5 rule.

A carpenter knows how to deal with the minutiae that architects and engineers don't have to think about, like accounting for the kerf of a saw blade when cutting a board, or drilling out a stripped screw, or assessing the likelihood a board will warp based on its grain.

The vast majority of software development is carpentry work. It's standard tools and standard assemblies and rules of thumb. It's making a thing that works by applying technology, without worrying too much about the scientific research and engineering that underpins the technologies involved.

Building software is blue collar work. And I think we should be proud of that.
