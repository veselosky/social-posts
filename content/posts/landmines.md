title: 'Landmines'
---
A piece of wisdom from my military days: The "easy way" is where the land mines are.

Way back in Marine boot camp, we spent a lot of our time "humping" (that is, moving on foot and carrying all our gear). But we never walked on the road, always on a path parallel to the road, slogging through weeds, ditches and mud. 

We all knew walking on the road would be much easier. So we asked the drill instructor why we couldn't walk on the road.

"Because that's where they put the land mines."

In the civilian world, there's (usually) nobody actively trying to blow you up. But every time I see what looks like an "easy" path to success and wonder why nobody is taking it, I remember what the drill instructor taught us.

Don't be fooled by the quick and easy path to success. That's where the land mines are.
