title: 'Cancel Netflix Creators List'
---
I 𝗰𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗱 my 𝗡𝗲𝘁𝗳𝗹𝗶𝘅 subscription. It was wasted money. Here are some creators I'm supporting with that money instead.


Netflix was just wasting my time. I would scroll for 20 minutes trying to find something to watch, then end up on YouTube anyway. I decided if I was going to spend money monthly, it should go to creators whose content I actually enjoy! Here are a few of them:


📰 Isaac Saul runs Tangle: an independent, nonpartisan, subscriber-supported politics newsletter that summarizes the best arguments from across the political spectrum on the news of the day. It's refreshing to have a rational view of the daily news.


💡 Carlton Gibson writes The Stack Report, a monthly newsletter on application development, operations, and the process (and business) of making software. He delivers years of software industry wisdom every month.


🛩️ Xyla Foxlin Is building a full-scale airplane in her garage from a century old design... so she can fly it! She's taking us on the journey with her via her YouTube channel. (She's also a literal Beauty Queen who sent her tiara into SPACE! Must-see TV!)


These are just a few of the independent creators I follow and support financially.


Next time you're scrolling a screen of thumbnails bored out of your mind by the big-budget dreck, consider whether your money isn't better spent supporting indie creators like these.
