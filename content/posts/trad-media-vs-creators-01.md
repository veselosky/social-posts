Traditional media is dying.  
The Creator Economy is the future.  
And I love it. Here's why:

Traditional media lost the thread a long time ago. They forgot that their purpose is to serve their community, and instead decided their purpose was to maximize shareholder value on the quarterly report.

The result has been a race to the bottom, where advertising CPMs are falling, driving them to seek higher page view
numbers on thinner margins, focusing on quantity rather than quality, on usage rather than utility. And we, the audience, see it. We've lost trust in traditional media.

But Creators in the new media economy know how to listen to their audience, create content that is actually valuable, and deliver that value to their community. They're building trust with their audience, and reaping the rewards.

Traditional media is crumbling under its own weight. Creators aren’t just filling the gap — they’re building something better. They seek to earn trust, not traffic. They serve a community, not a boardroom. And that's why I'm all-in on the Creator Economy.
