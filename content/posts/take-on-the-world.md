title: 'Take on the World'
---
Every day I wake up ready to take on the world.

Every night I go to bed feeling like I did, and the world kicked my ass.

Normally I try to take a lesson away from my little anecdotes, but... I got nothing.

If this sounds like you, well, at least you can take solace in the fact that it's not JUST you.

Hang in there brothers and sisters. There are still good days ahead.
