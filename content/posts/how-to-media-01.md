How to build a media business, then and now.

Old way:
1. Pick a topic to write about.
2. Publish a TON of keyword-stuffed content.
3. Buy ads to drive traffic.
4. Insert spammy ad network scripts to monetize.

New way:
1. Identify people with a problem you know how to solve.
2. Share focused advice to help them, and publish it widely.
3. Gather feedback to improve your solution.
4. Package your complete solution and sell it as a product or course.

Helping people is how you get the *right* attention for your business.
