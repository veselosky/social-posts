"What gets measured gets managed."  
You may think that means you should measure everything and set strict targets. That's dead wrong. Here's why:

That quote comes from a 1956 paper by V. F. Ridgway titled "Dysfunctional Consequences of Performance Measurements" and it's incomplete. Here's the full quote:

“What gets measured gets managed — even when it’s pointless to measure and manage it, and even if it harms the purpose of the organisation to do so.”

The fact that you can measure something doesn't make it important. Arguably the most important things to manage are the most difficult to measure. How does one measure relationships, good will, or loyalty?

Management icon W. Edwards Deming said we should eliminate numerical targets and goals and instead focus on improving the system within which we work. It's that system which dictates  performance, not the individual efforts of the workers in it.

If you want better results, improve your process, even if it is difficult or impossible to measure the individual improvements. The results will speak for themselves eventually.

Hat tip to Danny Buerkli for his post on Medium about this.
