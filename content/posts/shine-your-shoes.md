title: 'Shine Your Shoes'
---
When the world feels completely out of control… maybe the best thing to do is shine your shoes. 👞✨

There’s an old Depression-era song with that message: *“A Shine on Your Shoes”* — written when jobs were scarce, money was scarcer, and the future felt downright frightening. The message was simple, yet deep: when the world seems awful and you can't fix it, fix something else. Do something to make your little corner of the world brighter.

This weekend, I realized I needed some of that medicine.
🌍 Current events had me feeling powerless.
📦 I labeled and organized every cable and device in my overflowing box of tech gear.
🧹 Cleaned the spare room.
🍽️ Hand-washed the dishes.
👕 Washed and folded the laundry.

None of these chores changed the world. But they helped to change my mindset. Each small action was a way of reclaiming a bit of control, reminding myself that I can shape my environment, even if I can’t control the headlines. 

When you are feeling overwhelmed and helpless, when life's problems feel too big, start small. Clean out the closet. Organize that one messy drawer. Shine your shoes.

Those small victories can restore your sense of agency and give you the fortitude to face the larger tasks ahead.

You may not have the power to make the world better. But you have the power to make **your** world a little better. And if we all do that, maybe the changes will add up to a better world after all.
