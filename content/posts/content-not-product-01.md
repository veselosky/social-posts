title: Content Not Product 01
---
Creators: Never forget this fundamental truth. Content is not your product.

Content is a tool for building relationships.

Those relationships are the source of your business value.

If you start to think of content as a product, you'll make bad business decisions. Always think instead about serving your audience, the community you have built. 

Maintain high trust, serve your community's needs, and the value will follow.
