title: 'Your Limits Are Not Where You Think'
---
A piece of wisdom from my military days: Your limits are not where you think they are.

Before I went to Marine boot camp, there were a lot of things I thought I couldn't do.

I didn't think I could run a 10k. Or even 5k.

I didn't think I could make a head shot at 500 yards. (Paper targets only!)

I certainly didn't think I could swim while wearing combat boots and a fully loaded pack.

But when pressed, I did all those things. I remember thinking, everything in life will look easy after this.

Well, that wasn't quite true, but that experience gave me the confidence to tackle the hard stuff in life. Usually, I'm able to push past where I thought my limits were. Sometimes I give 100% and fail anyway. That's okay.

We all have limits. But we don't really know where they are until we try to push past them. 

Don't be afraid to take on that challenge. Your limits are not where you think they are.
