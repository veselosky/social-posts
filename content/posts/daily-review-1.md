Lately I've felt my productivity tanking. I decided to make some changes.

Here's one: A Daily Review. It's important because:

- It helps align daily tasks with long-term goals.
- It helps you identify distractions to eliminate.
- It helps keep you motivated to drive forward.

Here's how I do it:

At the end of every day, I write down everything I accomplished that day. Seriously, everything. Mowed the lawn. Read a book. Whatever I spent significant time on.

Then, I decide on no more than three important tasks for the next day. Sometimes it's just one, if it's a big one, but never more than three. If I have too many, I can get unfocused or even overwhelmed.

The next morning, I check this list before I start to remind me what I need to accomplish that day.

That's it. It's a total of ten minutes at most. But it keeps me focused and progressing toward my goals.

What daily routines make you more productive? Let me know in the comments, I need the help!
