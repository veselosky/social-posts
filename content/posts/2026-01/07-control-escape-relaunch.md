title: 'Control Escape Relaunch'

🚀 **Control-Escape is back.**

**Control your data. Escape vendor lock-in. Own your platform.**

I first published **Control-Escape** more than **25 years ago**, when the internet was an inflating bubble:

• AOL and Netscape ruled the stock market
• Google was a scrappy startup preaching *“Don’t be evil”*
• Linux was a weird, exciting, UNIX-like OS few people understood

Back then, I was tired of proprietary licensing and predatory software practices. I wanted to understand Linux, open-source software, and a different way of computing — one owned by its users, not vendors. Control-Escape became my public notebook: a place to document everything I was learning and share it with others on the same path.

Over the years, the site survived — sometimes barely.

The tech evolved. It moved through **hand-coded HTML**, **Perl**, **PHP**, **Python**, **Django**, and multiple static site generators (including a few I wrote myself).

Linux evolved. Much of the old content aged out.

Now it’s **2026**, and the irony is hard to miss:

🌍 Linux powers everything from internet servers to the phone in your pocket
🗒️ AOL and Netscape are historical footnotes
🏢 Google has become a data-hoarding, privacy-violating poster child for surveillance capitalism
👹 Internet services have become so bad, Cory Doctorow coined word for it: *enshittification*.

So I’ve **relaunched Control-Escape** with a renewed focus:

👉 Digital independence
👉 Self-hosted alternatives to cloud services
👉 Building and owning your own websites and tools
👉 Linux and open-source software: practical, modern, and relevant again

This isn’t nostalgia. It’s a response to where the internet has gone, and where it *should* go next.

If you care about:
• Owning your data
• Escaping vendor lock-in
• Building durable, boring, reliable technology
• Creating on platforms you actually control

I’d love for you to follow along.

**Control your data. Escape vendor lock-in. Own your platform.**
