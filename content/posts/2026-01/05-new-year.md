In 2026, I resolve to **STOP trying to fix my flaws**.
Isn't that the opposite of what you're supposed to do? No. Here's why:

The list of things I am bad at is practically infinite. I don't have the time or energy to fix all of them. Even if I tried, the payoff is terrible — moving from *bad* to *average* is a pathetic goal.

- I could resolve to go to the gym, but I'll never be an athlete.
- I could resolve to drop a few pounds, but I'll just put them right back on.
- I could resolve to learn to cook, but I'd still probably eat pizza Friday nights.

I'm resolving to do the opposite. I’m doubling down on the small number of things I’m *already good at*. 

I’m sharpening those skills. I’m using them to create real value for other people — value they couldn’t easily create for themselves. And yes, I hope to capture *some* of that value for myself.

I'm done wasting energy trying to crawl from terrible to mediocre. 

This year, I'm putting that energy toward climbing from *good* to *great*.

👉 What are you already good at?
👉 How much impact could you have if you were 50% better at it?
👉 Or 100%?

Maybe the biggest gains don’t come from fixing what’s broken, but from amplifying what already works.
